# canvas-tutorial
Each file introduces a new HTML5 canvas concept.
You start out with the file "a0-canvas-start.htm" and proceed to "a2-canvas-inline.htm" and so forth through each step.
Almost every file is an HTML file that includes the CSS and JavaScript needed. A few of the html files have a separate .js file.
